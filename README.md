Resized version of the XC9536 board to fit into 5x5cm, to make it cheaper to produce at seeed studio or similar services.
~~It should also now fit on a breadboard if you use straight pins (not tested yet).~~
Although it can be connected into a regular sized prototyping breadboard, it will cover all its width making it a pain to use : you'd have to remove the board to change the wiring.
